# viktor-nv1-engine

The audio engine of the [Viktor NV-1 Synth](http://nicroto.github.io/viktor/).

## Install

```shell
$ npm --save viktor-nv1-engine
```

## Use

```javascript
var NV1Engine = require( "viktor-nv1-engine" ),
	AudioContext = global.AudioContext || global.webkitAudioContext,
	store = require( "store" ),
	{dawEngine, patchLibrary} = NV1Engine.create( AudioContext, store);
```

If you want even more control on the init process of the engine, you should check the implementation of the `NV1Engine.create()` function, which right now looks like this:

```javascript
var DAW = require( "./daw/daw" ),
	Synth = require( "./instruments/synth/instrument" ),
	PatchLibrary = require( "./patches/library" );

// ...

exports.create = function( AudioContext, store ) {

	var patchLibrary = new PatchLibrary( "VIKTOR_SYNTH", require( "./patches/defaults" ), store ),
		dawEngine = new DAW(
			AudioContext,
			[
				Synth
			],
			patchLibrary.getSelected().patch
		);

	return {
		dawEngine: dawEngine,
		patchLibrary: patchLibrary
	};

};

```

The function returns an object with 2 fields - `dawEngine` and `patchLibrary`.

`dawEngine` is a shell around the actual synth, which theoretically (hasn't been used, yet) can hold more than 1 instrument. It also separates the pitch-bend wheel, modulation wheel, Effects Section and master volume from the instrument(s).

`patchLibrary` is a service object to provide library of pre-defined patches, save and delete custom patches, export & import whole libraries.

### This package is intended for use with Browserify

There is only one thing you need to do in order to instantiate the Viktor NV-1 engine in your app - to copy the `src/daw/non-npm/tuna/impulses` dir to the root of your web app.

You can, for example, have a grunt task (using `grunt-contrib-copy`) to copy it automatically as part of your build process:

```javascript
grunt.initConfig( {

		// ...

		copy: {
			main: {
				files: [
					// ...
					{
						expand: true,
						cwd: "node_modules/viktor-nv1-engine/src/daw/non-npm/tuna/impulses/",
						src: "**",
						dest: "path/to/app/impulses/"
					}
				]
			}
		},

		// ...

} );

// ...
grunt.loadNpmTasks('grunt-contrib-copy');
// ...

```

## API

To be able to manipulate the sound of Viktor NV-1, you need to know the API of the `DAW` and `Synth` objects. And if you don't want to write your own, you can use the default PatchLibrary. Lets start with DAW's interface.

### DAW

```javascript
var DAW = require( "viktor-nv1-engine" ).DAW;
```

DAW is an abstraction around the synth. Pitch-bend, modulation, effects and master volume are part of it. It can load more than 1 instrument. Patches are on DAW level, not on Synth level.

When instantiating a DAW object, you pass the AudioContext, an array of Instrument types (not instantiated - daw will instantiate them) and a simple (serializable to JSON) object with the selected patch's settings.

DAW uses the Web MIDI Api internally, parses and executes system MIDI messages and exposes a public API for receiving MIDI messages from any caller.

DAW is your entry point to the engine:

 * to play a sound you call the `daw.externalMidiMessage()` method with the respective MIDI message;
 * to change a setting on any of listed-above controls you set a property (`daw.pitchSettings` for example);
 * to access the Synth object you iterate on the `daw.instruments` array;
 * to set the current patch (changing all available settings) you call the `daw.loadPatch()` method;
 * to observe settings changes you add a handler through `daw.onPatchChange()`;
 * to select an instrument you call the `daw.selectInstrument()`.

#### `new DAW( AudioContext, instrumentTypes, selectedPatch )`

**Params:**
 * AudioContext: the audio context provided by the system (browser);
 * instrumentTypes: `[Instrument,...]` check the interface of `src/instruments/synth/instrument.js` for reference of expected interface;
 * selectedPatch: simple (serializable to JSON) `Object` with the settings of the entire engine (daw + instruments) - check the `src/patches/defaults` to see the format of a patch;

**Returns:** `Object`, on which you need to call the async init method in order to finish initialization.

#### `daw.init( callback )`

**Params:**
 * callback: `Function` to be called (with no params) after finished;

**Returns:** `undefined`.

#### `daw.loadPatch( patch[, quiet] )`

**Params:**
 * patch: `Object` serializable to JSON, representing the settings of the engine:

```

 * quiet: optional `Boolean` set to true if setting the patch shouldn't be announced to subscribers (daw.onPatchChange()).

**Returns:** `undefined`.

#### `daw.getPatch()`

**Returns:** `Object` serializable to JSON. Check daw.loadPatch() for reference of the structure.

#### `daw.onPatchChange( handler )`

**Params:**
 * handler( patch ): `Function` to be called after new patch is being set (after daw.loadPatch() is called). Passes the new patch object being loaded.

**Returns:** `undefined`.

#### `daw.selectInstrument( index )`

**Params:**
 * index: `Number`, integer, the index of instrument to be selected. Only the selected instrument gets called on MIDI messages.

**Returns:** `undefined`.

#### `daw.externalMidiMessage( midiMessage )`

**Params:**
 * midiMessage: `Object`, raw midi message to be executed by the engine. You can use this method if you build a UI for playing the NV-1. Here is the structure of the message:

```javascript
{
	data: [
		Number,
		Number,
		Number
	]
}
```

**Returns:** `undefined`.

#### `daw.addExternalMidiMessageHandler( handler )`

**Params:**
 * handler( eventType, parsed, rawEvent ): `Function` to be called on any MIDI message executed (whenever someone calls the above daw.externalMidiMessage() method or if the Web MIDI Api passes a MIDI message). Passes the new patch object being loaded.
	 * eventType: `String` - currently one of these [ "pitchBend", "modulationWheel", "notePress" ];
	 * parsed: null or `Object`, if successfully decoded, with decoded data from the raw MIDI message:

```javascript
{
	isPitchBend: Boolean,
	isModulationWheel: Boolean,
	pitchBend: { value: Number, range: [ Number, Number ] },
	modulation: { value: Number, range: [ Number, Number ] },
	isNoteOn: Boolean,
	noteFrequency: Number,
	velocity: Number
}
```

	 * rawEvent: `Object`, the raw MIDI message, with this structure:

```javascript
{
	data: [
		Number,
		Number,
		Number
	]
}
```

**Returns:** `undefined`.

### NV1Param (setting parameter)

Settings mostly contain NV1Param's which specify a value, but also a range of variance of that value.

```javascript
{
	value: Number,
	range: [ Number, Number ]
}
```

Having the range helps tremendously when you need to represent ranges with a UI and you need to convert between what a Web Audio param accepts (what usually stays in the settings of the engine) and what needs to be displayed in the UI.

I've released a npm package to help with conversion between ranges, called `viktor-nv1-settings-convertor`.
Check the pitchSettings property bellow for example.

#### `daw.pitchSettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	bend: NV1Param
}
```

Here is how you can get the param and covert it in the 0-128 range:

```javascript
var settingsConvertor = require( "viktor-nv1-settings-convertor" ),
	settings = daw.pitchSettings,
	originalRange = settings.bend.range;

var paramInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.bend, [ 0, 128 ] );
```

An once you need to change it in the daw engine (**You should only set the full object not its properties!**):

```javascript
daw.pitchSettings = {
	bend: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( paramInNewRange, originalRange )
};
```

#### `daw.modulationSettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	rate: NV1Param
}
```

Here is how you can get the param and covert it in the 0-128 range:

```javascript
var settingsConvertor = require( "viktor-nv1-settings-convertor" ),
	settings = daw.modulationSettings,
	originalRange = settings.rate.range;

var paramInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.rate, [ 0, 128 ] );
```

An once you need to change it in the daw engine (**You should only set the full object not its properties!**):

```javascript
daw.modulationSettings = {
	rate: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( paramInNewRange, originalRange )
};
```

#### `daw.delaySettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	time: NV1Param,
	feedback: NV1Param,
	dry: NV1Param,
	wet: NV1Param
}
```

Here is how you can get all params and covert them in the 0-128 range, for example:

```javascript
var settingsConvertor = require( "viktor-nv1-settings-convertor" ),
	settings = daw.delaySettings;

// transposeParam creates a new object
// meaning the original ranges will stay untouched
var timeInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.time, [ 0, 128 ] ),
	feedbackInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.feedback, [ 0, 128 ] ),
	dryInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.dry, [ 0, 128 ] ),
	wetInNewRange = settingsConvertor.transposeParam( settings.wet, [ 0, 128 ] ),
```

An once you need to change them in the daw engine (**You should only set the full object not its properties!**):

```javascript
daw.delaySettings = {
	time: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( timeInNewRange, settings.time.range ),
	feedback: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( feedbackInNewRange, settings.feedback.range ),
	dry: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( dryInNewRange, settings.dry.range ),
	wet: settingsConvertor.transposeParam( wetInNewRange, settings.wet.range )
};
```

#### `daw.compressorSettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	threshold: NV1Param,
	ratio: NV1Param,
	knee: NV1Param,
	attack: NV1Param,
	release: NV1Param,
	makeupGain: NV1Param,
	enabled: NV1Param
}
```

**You should only set the full object not individual properties!**

Check the daw.delaySettings for reference on getting and setting a daw setting property.

#### `daw.reverbSettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	level: NV1Param
}
```

**You should only set the full object not individual properties!**

Check the daw.delaySettings for reference on getting and setting a daw setting property.

#### `daw.masterVolumeSettings` property

`Object` with structure:

```javascript
{
	level: NV1Param
}
```
**You should only set the full object not individual properties!**

Check the daw.delaySettings for reference on getting and setting a daw setting property.

### Synth

```javascript
var Synth = require( "viktor-nv1-engine" ).Synth;
```

To get the actual instance created by the daw:

```javascript
var DAW = require( "viktor-nv1-engine" ).DAW,
	Synth = require( "viktor-nv1-engine" ).Synth,
	daw = new DAW(/*...*/),
	synth;

daw.init( function() {

	daw.instruments.forEach( function( instrument ) {
		if ( instrument instanceof Synth ) {
			synth = instrument;
			// use the instance
		}
	} );

} );
```

Check the actual source, if you want to extend the engine and add another instrument.
